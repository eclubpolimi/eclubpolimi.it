- **Concrete**: Replace vague promises with specific benefits and outcomes
- **Inclusive**: Welcome students from all backgrounds and experience levels

### Key Messages to Emphasize
1. Student-run and student-led organization
2. Cross-university collaboration (Politecnico + Bocconi + others)
3. Practical, hands-on learning approach
4. Real outcomes: funding, co-founders, job opportunities
5. Community aspect: lifelong friendships and networks

### SEO Considerations
- Include keywords like "student entrepreneurs," "university startup," "Milan entrepreneurship"
- Mention specific universities (Politecnico di Milano, Bocconi)
- Include location-based terms (Milan, Italy, Europe)
